# Kyzlo Prompting

**The photography director in your pocket.**

## The Problem

You've seen them everywhere—those impossibly realistic AI images of tiny bananas wearing sombreros, nano bananas as medieval knights, microscopic bananas in coffee shops. The nano banana trend took over Gemini, but there's a gap between "banana at sunset" and the hyperrealistic masterpieces flooding your feed.

The difference? Professional photography vocabulary.

Generic prompts produce generic results. But when you speak the language of a seasoned product photographer—terms like *subsurface scattering*, *chromatic aberration*, *computational bokeh with edge detection artifacts*—AI image generators suddenly understand what "real" looks like.

Most people don't have a decade of photography experience. That's where Kyzlo comes in.

## What Kyzlo Does

Kyzlo is an AI prompt engineer trained on the vocabulary of elite photographers. You give it a simple concept:

> *"banana wearing a tiny cowboy hat at sunset"*

Kyzlo transforms it into a technically precise shooting specification that reads like notes from a Magnum photographer:

> *SUBJECT: A diminutive Cavendish banana, no larger than a human thumbnail, its waxy cuticle catching rim light at grazing angles. Perched atop its crown sits a meticulously crafted cowboy hat, leather texture rendered with sebaceous surface quality and localized specular hotspots...*

The output isn't just descriptive—it's engineered. Every term is chosen to push Gemini toward photorealism: sensor noise patterns, lens aberrations, computational photography artifacts, the specific color science of iPhone versus Pixel.

## The Secret Sauce

Kyzlo draws from extensive vocabulary banks:

**Focus & Depth**
- Tack-sharp with razor-thin plane of focus
- Micro hunting blur from autofocus acquisition
- Eye detect lock with perfect subject separation

**Lighting**
- Subsurface scattering through translucent banana skin
- Caustic light patterns from refractive surfaces
- Golden hour wrap with warm directional quality

**Lens Character**
- Chromatic aberration on high contrast edges
- Bokeh rendering with cats eye shapes in corners
- Natural vignette falloff

**Digital Artifacts**
- Computational bokeh with edge detection errors
- Night mode temporal stacking with motion ghosting
- Smart HDR tone mapping with lifted shadows

These aren't random buzzwords. They're the fingerprints of real photography—the imperfections and artifacts that our brains recognize as authentic.

## How To Use

1. **Enter your concept** — Keep it simple. "Banana as a wizard" or "banana in a tiny kitchen" works perfectly.

2. **Select your camera** — Choose from iPhone 15 Pro, Sony A7IV, Fujifilm X100V, or Canon R5. Each has distinct rendering characteristics that Kyzlo will simulate.

3. **Generate** — Kyzlo produces a detailed prompt structured as flowing prose, ready to paste directly into Gemini.

4. **Copy & Create** — Hit copy, paste into Gemini's image generator, and watch the magic happen.

## The Philosophy

Photography is a language. Every camera, every lens, every lighting setup speaks with a distinct voice. Kyzlo translates your ideas into that language—not with generic descriptors like "beautiful" or "cinematic," but with the precise terminology that separates snapshots from art.

The nano banana is just the beginning. Any subject. Any scene. Kyzlo makes it real.
